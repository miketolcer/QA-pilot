<h1>Pilot Support and The Process of QA</h1>
<p>Let’s start with some Pilot support! Take some time to read through this conversation between a customer and a QA:</p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Hey, this last delivery was awful.”</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: “I’m sorry it wasn’t a good experience, can you tell me what wasn’t good?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Well, first and foremost, it was ugly.”</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: “Just so you know, the app is an early prototype, but if you have any styling requests, we can definitely talk about those.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Oh, I thought we were going to be stuck with that, you’re saying that your team will fix it?”</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: “There are going to be changes to the user interface and styling, yeah. You can expect the final product to be far more polished on the UI.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Great, great. Well, that’s good. It still doesn’t save any of the changes we’re making.”</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: “Yeah, that has to do with it being a prototype too, getting the database set up and hooked in is coming up on the roadmap.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Good, because your test data is wrong, and it’s missing fields too.”</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: Oh, what fields are missing?</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer: “Well, the email field’s not there, I can’t search, and I can’t log in/out either.</strong></p>
<p><em>QA: “I see. I’ll look into it, but I know at least some of this is coming up soon. Just to make sure my notes are right, you needed the email field for the contact card, to be able to search the employee list, and want to be able to log in and out as a user?”</em></p>
<p>This conversation is in reference to this application: Employee Manager v1.0 (<a class="reference external" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.0_Version/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.0_Version/index.html</a>)</p>
<p>Take some time again to explore this site to understand it better.</p>
<p>Now think back to the previous conversation, take some time to answer these questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Was the customer justified with their complaints?</p></li>
<li><p>Did the QA do a good job responding to the customer’s complaints?</p></li>
<li><p>Would you address them in a different way?</p></li>
<li><p>What information would you need to adequately respond to their concerns?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the conversation above, create a checklist of features that the customer would like the website to do.</p>
<p>Try to imagine yourself as a customer in this situation, what features would you want this employee manager site to have?</p>
<p>Now that you’ve thought about things from the customer perspective, let’s shift back into the QA mindset.</p>
<p>Here’s some documentation for Employee Manager: <a class="reference external" href="https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.0_README.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.0_README.html</a></p>
<p>Let’s remember what the Process of QA is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Planning</p></li>
<li><p>Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Reporting</p></li>
<li><p>Following Up</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the documentation above to create a document that answers these questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What are you testing?</p></li>
<li><p>How long will you test for?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there pieces you aren’t going to test?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan on testing?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know when you’re done testing?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these questions, you’re starting to create a plan for your testing, the first step of the Process of QA!</p>
<p>Now you’ll want to use that plan and take the next 30 minutes to do some testing! Take a close look at each feature in the application! This is the next phase, the actual testing!</p>
<p>Now based on your findings from running some tests, create a report with a list of all the issues/bug you found, but also include the positives! If you think the application is a good start, be sure to say that!</p>
<p>And our last phase, following up. Take the next 30 minutes to write out a report to the customer from earlier in the lab. Include the issues you’ve found, and how you’d plan to address their questions and concerns.</p>
